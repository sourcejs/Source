# SourceJS REST API

From 0.4.0 version, SourceJS started to grow own REST API for flexible plugins development and easy side services integration. API provides full access to Spec contents, navigation tree and other useful features.

## GET Specs

[Get](/api/specs) access to Specs navigation tree with filtering by various options. This Navigation tree is used to build search, catalog pages and digests, here you can also read all `info.json` configuration of each Spec.

```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/specs
```

### Parameters

All parameters must be passed as JSON with request, except `id` that accepts regular param as well. List of available params:

| Param | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| id | String | Get specific Spec information by ID - `base/btn`, `docs/spec` ([example](/api/specs?id=docs/spec)). |
| filter | Object | Return list of items by filter (filter something that we want to see). |
| filterOut | Object | Return list of items by filter (filter something that we DON'T want to see). |

Possible combinations:

```
[id|filter|filterOut], [filter|filterOut]
```

### Filters

These parameters are equal for `filter` and `filterOut` objects:

| Param | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| filter.cats, filterOut.cats | Array with strings | Filter by Spec categories. |
| filter.fields, filterOut.fields | Array with strings | Filter by existing files in `info.json`. |
| filter.tags, filterOut.tags | Array with strings | Filter by specified tags in `info.json`. |

And another custom param for filter:

| Param | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| filter.forceTags | Array with strings | Filter by specified tags in `info.json`. |

`filter.forceTags` has priority over `filterOut.tags`, if you want to force get all specs having specific tags.
